The national government has successfully relied on global financiers for the implementation of mega and major projects in Kenya. For the year ending June, however, the foreign lenders lowered funding for some projects in the East African country by at least 66.8 billion. These lenders include the World Bank, African Development Bank (AfDB), and China Exim Bank. The funding cutbacks affected at least 19 projects in Kenya some of which have been either shelved or delayed indefinitely. Reportedly the most affected are the roads and energy infrastructure projects. One of the most affected projects include the Kamburu-Embu-Thika Transmission Line project. The China Exim Bank has reportedly cut funding for this project by Sh4.5 billion. This is one of the largest cuts. The 1,045 km 500 kV High Voltage Direct Current (HVDC) Ethiopia-Kenya Interconnector project has also lost approximately Sh3.15 billion from the AfDB. Also known as the Eastern Electricity Highway, this project seeks to connect Kenya and Ethiopia’s grids. The Gilgil-Thika Konza 400 KV Transmission Line project funding by the World Bank has been reduced by Sh2.3 billion. Another project that seeks to increase power access through cutting construction charges and which is funded by the Bank has shrunk by Sh2.9 billion. The foreign lenders also slashed Sh2 billion meant for Ol Karia geothermal power plants and Sh1.9 billion for the Loiyangalani-Marsabit Transmission Line. Not only energy infrastructure projects have suffered the cutback but also road projects. The dualling of the 41.7 km of the Mombasa–Mariakani Highway for example has been docked Sh1.6 billion.
