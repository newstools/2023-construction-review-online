However, if there are leaks, it may signify that your roof needs replacing. In some cases, the flashing that keeps water away from cracks and openings in the roof may have broken down. Also, the protective waterproof layer that keeps water off your roof and prevents it from entering your property may be damaged.

Roofs have a limited lifespan, depending on the material. For instance, wood shingles might last 30 years, and metal roofs 40 to 70 years. So, if your roof has exceeded its age limit, it’s advisable to replace it. If you aren’t sure how old your building’s roof is, frequent repairs may indicate your roof is too old. A commercial roofer can estimate its age and advise if a new one is necessary. They can also help you choose a high-quality and more durable roof for a replacement.

It can also trigger asthma symptoms. Iron sheets, shingles, gutters, and other roofing materials will loosen or wear out due to harsh weather conditions, improper installation, or normal aging.
