Network Rail is focusing on work to redevelop the historic Chepstow Viaduct bridge over the river Wye. Engineers will strengthen and rebuild the viaduct abutments as part of the £4.6 million project. The project also involves masonry, steelwork, and waterproofing repairs. Isambard Kingdom Brunel gave the order to construct the Chepstow Railway Bridge in 1852. Despite its appearance, the “Great Tubular Bridge” over the River Wye at Chepstow, which at that location marks the border between Wales and England, is regarded as one of Brunel’s greatest accomplishments. It utilised materials sparingly and would serve as the design model for Brunel’s Royal Albert Bridge at Saltash. The tubular iron supports built by Brunel are still in place. However, the superstructure has since been replaced. It is a Grade II listed structure.

As part of the Severn Estuary Resilience Programme, significant upgrades are also being made in the direction of Lydney. Project manager for the Network Rail scheme Lee Ackerman stated: “It’s an honour to be renovating a classic example of railroad engineering. For more than 150 years, this bridge has been a crucial link between Wales and England. Thus, we intend to make sure that it can do so for many more years to come. As always, we want to finish this project as quickly and safely as we can with the least amount of disruption possible. The Chepstow Viaduct bridge is expected to be under construction until the end of the year. However, there shouldn’t be any disruptions to train service. This is because most of the work will be done between the hours of 7.30 am and 5.30 pm to minimise noise pollution for the neighbourhood.
