Work is set to kick off on the second phase of Harper Court in Hyde Park. This project will be carried out on top of the existing retail and will replace the restaurant in Chicago. The project site is an irregularly shaped lot on the block bound by E. 52nd St to the north, S. Lake Park Ave to the east, E. 53rd St to the south, and S. Harper Ave to the west. The northwest corner of the block is being developed by developers Beacon Capital Partners and Trammell Crow in partnership with the University of Chicago. It is currently partially occupied by the Park 52 restaurant complex and the Harper Court Phase 1 retail podium. Additionally, the project’s scope has changed from the first plan. Interactive Design Architects and Elkus Manfredi Architects are collaborating on the design. The research lab building will have 13 stories and 295,000 square feet of rentable lab space. It is intended to be a top-notch research institution of which the University of Chicago will lease 50,000 square feet. Furthermore, the amended scope will permit greater floor plates for tenants while lowering the height to 215 feet, whereas the prior design planned for a higher tower overlooking S. Lake Park Ave. Also Read: Renovation of 225 W.
