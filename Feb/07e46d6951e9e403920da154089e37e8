The construction of the $1.1 billion Ndayane deepwater port in Senegal is expected to resume after being delayed for more than 12 months. The Senegalese government, in conjunction with DP World, started the project a year ago. The project stopped after the government failed to give out its contribution to start the project. Recently, however, Macky Sall, Senegal’s president, announced that money would be provided to continue the construction of the port south of Senegal’s Dakar. According to reports the project will restart this month. It will be implemented in two phases. The project’s first phase will cost $837 million. It will increase the container handling capacity of Ndayane deepwater port in Senegal by 1.2 million TEUs per year. In addition, it will enable the port to handle the largest container vessels in the world.

In this phase, an additional container quay of 1,350 feet will be developed. The entire project, located 30 miles from Dakar and close to the Blaise Diagne International airport, is set to be completed in 2026. It will be the largest single private investment in the country’s history. The modern and deep Ndayane deepwater port in Senegal with up to 10,000 feet of quayside is designed to boost the country’s position as a major trade hub and gateway to West Africa and Northwest Africa. It will thus create jobs, increase the country’s attractiveness to foreign investors, and open economic opportunities for Senegalese businesses. Currently, Senegal depends on the Dakar port for its imports and exports. It also serves as a gateway to neighboring landlocked countries such as Mali. Furthermore, it is expected to ease the pressure at the Dakar port.
