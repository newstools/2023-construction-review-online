Garden landscaping can have a positive effect on property value by increasing the curb appeal and overall aesthetic appeal of a home. A well-maintained and attractive landscape can make a property stand out, which can make it more desirable to potential buyers. A well-designed landscape can also make a property appear larger, and it can create an inviting outdoor living space. Research has shown that properties with well-maintained landscaping can sell for a higher price. A study by the American Society of Landscape Architects found that landscaping can increase property values by as much as 15%. It’s important to note that while garden landscaping can increase property value, it’s not a guarantee and it depends on the quality of the landscaping and how well it is maintained. Landscaping that is poorly designed or poorly maintained can actually decrease property value. Overall, garden landscaping can be a great investment in a property, as it can not only increase its value but also improve the overall enjoyment of living in the property by creating a beautiful outdoor living space.
