A contract has been awarded for the construction of Student Housing for the University of Fraser Valley. The contract was awarded by the University of Fraser Valley in British Columbia, Canada, to Turner Construction and Clark Builders, its majority-owned partner firm. The CA$73 million contract covers the construction of a six-story mass wood student housing building. 398 beds will be housed in the six-story mass wood structure on the university’s Abbotsford campus. The campus is located about 40 miles southeast of Vancouver. According to a provincial announcement, British Columbia will contribute CA$ 70.3 million to the project. This is part of a bigger initiative to provide more than 8,000 extra on-campus beds across the province by 2028. The Passive House Building Certification-compliant student living facility will have lounges, communal kitchens, and study areas. Additionally, there will be spaces for mixed-use and cultural activities. The energy and resource efficiency requirements of Passive House are among the tightest in the world. The project will be carried out using an integrated project delivery method. This is a construction technique that strives to maximize efficiency and participation from all project participants during all stages.
