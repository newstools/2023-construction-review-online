The Mumbai Rail Vikas Corporation (MRVC) has begun construction works for the Panvel-Karjat Railway Project. The project will be the longest tunnel on the suburban railway, in Mumbai. Moreover, it will be a part of three tunnels that include Kirwali and Nadhal. Currently, the Persic tunnel that is right between Diva and Thane is the longest in Mumbai, stretching 1.3 kilometers. Upon completion, the Panvel-Karjat Railway Project will be double the length of the Persic tunnel. Thus, it will span 2.6 kilometers.

These include Chowk, Panvel, Mohope, Chikhale, and Karjat. It will involve the construction of a parallel line to the current single-line section. As a result, it will create a suburban corridor. Thereafter, the project would serve as an alternate route from Mumbai’s main island city to Karjat via Panel. It would therefore contribute towards shortening commute times between Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Terminus (CSMT) and Karjat. Currently, the earthworks, as well as bridge construction work, are underway. In total, construction works will include 15 road underpasses (RUB), three tunnels, and 44 bridges. A flyover and seven road bridges will also be constructed. The Panvel-Karjat Railway Project’s development costs Rs 2,782 crore and aims for completion by March 2025. Its completion plays a key role in the Mumbai Urban Transport Project 3 (MUTP-3). Overall, its objective strives to enhance the service quality, and network capacity. Additionally, it also aims to heighten the safety of Mumbai’s suburban railway system. Right within the Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR), the MUTP-3 will improve the mobility and safety of the population in general. Moreover, it will provide a more efficient and better connection between the various districts.
