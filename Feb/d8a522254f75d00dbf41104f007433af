Pacific Square, a mixed-use residential development in San Gabriel, Los Angeles, is set to begin construction this month. The developer, Pacific Plaza Premier Development Group, held a groundbreaking ceremony to ascertain its preparedness for the start of the project. The residential project is slated for a nearly six-acre site at 700-800 San Gabriel Boulevard. It will include 243 one-, two-, and three-bedroom homes. Additionally, there will be eight live/work units that are street-facing and roughly 73,000 square feet of ground-floor commercial space. Proposals also include 983 vehicles semi-subterranean parking. Pacific Square was planned by Media Portfolio’s Richard Abe, an architect. It consists of two five-story structures that would border an about 23,000-square-foot park area. Furthermore, it will open to Gladys Avenue on the eastern property boundary. Plans are for a 10,000-square-foot plaza facing San Gabriel Boulevard to the west.

Preferred Bank supplied construction finance for Pacific Square. It is anticipated to open a new branch on the building’s ground floor once it is finished. A few other projects in San Gabriel that combine housing and commercial space are similar to this one, and another one has been proposed for a site just half a mile to the north at 220 South San Gabriel Boulevard. San Gabriel’s agricultural background is reflected in the enormous, vacant development plot that will one day become Pacific Square. The Yoshimura family, who still runs a retail store across San Gabriel Boulevard, owned the property when it was a nursery. Recently, the nursery commemorated its 100th birthday.
