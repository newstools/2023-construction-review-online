These include a 430-meter ice rink as well as a penguinarium. Interestingly, it is also home to a colony of king and gentoo penguins. Furthermore, the project includes a storytelling-integration experience. Additionally, it includes a ‘Desert Blizzard’ theme, that resembles an imaginary world. The theme draws inspiration from Oman’s sand dunes and cityscapes, all covered in real snow. In addition to the spectacular creativity, the project still retails and reflects the local heritage as well as culture. While commenting on the project, the CEO of MAF expressed pride in presenting their newest addition to their impressive and ever-expanding portfolio. Snow Entertainment, Ignace Lahoud, further added, plays a significant role in the growth of local economics. Furthermore, the Snow Oman Park Project is an excellent demonstration of Majid Al Futtaim’s commitment. More especially, in the delivery of innovative experiences for guests across the region. In 2005, MAF was able to bring real snow into the desert and launch Ski Dubai, Middle East’s first-ever indoor ski resort. 10 years later, MAF expanded its footprint and officially launched Ski Egypt. Yet again, making history, the project was and still is renowned as a first of its kind in the region.
