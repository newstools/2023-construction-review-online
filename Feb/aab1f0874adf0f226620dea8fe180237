Shuttle drop-off areas, coffee shops, a restaurant, and 58,000 square feet of open space will be featured. A sizable central courtyard and smaller pocket parks opening onto Washington Boulevard will be included. Furthermore, along the southern perimeter of the campus, are among the amenities planned for the complex’s interior. The internet company first set up shop in the area in 2014, then in 2018 it decided to lease the full 128,000 square foot building at 8777 Washington Boulevard, assuming HBO’s former location. The development of the project will take place in two stages. Construction will start as early as this year and completion is anticipated for either late 2024 or early 2026. This will depend on the state of the market. The new campus is anticipated to double Apple’s footprint in Los Angeles, which currently includes more than 500,000 square feet used by Apple TV+, Music, and other businesses and is estimated to have around 1,500 employees overall before plans were announced to grow it further up to 3,000 in 2026, with the new project allowing up to 2,400 employees in total when it is finished.
