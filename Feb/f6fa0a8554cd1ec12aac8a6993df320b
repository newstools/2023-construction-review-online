It is set to process incremented raw gas volumes from the greater Jubilee and TEN fields. In addition, it will process raw gas with the natural gas liquids being fractionated into pure components like propane, butane, pentane, and stabilized condensate. According to the GNGC executive officer Dr. Asante, the Train 2 gas processing plant in Ghana will enable Ghana Gas to become a fully integrated gas services company. Moreover, it will enable the company to offer a reliable gas supply in the country and western African countries. Furthermore, the plant will help increase Ghana’s electricity generating capacity, which will solve the challenges of a power outage.
