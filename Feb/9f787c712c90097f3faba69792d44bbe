The department’s body, Rand Water, is the key factor behind the construction of the reservoir. This is as part of its expansion plan to maintain strategic storage equivalent to 24 hours of water demand, particularly in light of the current challenges with the country’s power supply.

It distributes potable water to a number of municipalities via two outgoing pipelines. Each pipeline has a diameter of 2,100 mm. They receive water from the Zuikerbosch purification plant as well as the pumping station via two pipes. Based on a compounded growth rate of 2% for the areas, the reservoir would provide more water storage. It would also supply in areas in the east of the Tshwane and Ekurhuleni Metropolitan Municipalities until 2035. The Vlakfontein Reservoir, which has a capacity of 200 ML, is the largest post tensioned reservoir in the country. This is according to the Department of Water and Sanitation. Also, it is listed as a dam with huge safety risks, and when it was being designed, strict safety guidelines had to be followed. The reservoir’s construction kicked off in May 2020. Construction works are expected to be completed in April 2023. Locals in wards 24 and 110 in the Ekurhuleni Local Municipality now have access to about 220 available jobs thanks to the project. Mchunu dismissed public opinion during the launch that the water sector is on the verge of collapse and disaster. Mchunu took note of the extensive work being carried out by Rand Water in Gauteng and other regions of the country, including the execution of infrastructure development planning that involves planning for the renovation and augmentation of infrastructure and putting that plan into action. In addition, the Minister urged residents to report destruction to their local authorities and to avoid vandalism of water infrastructure.
