The Federal Executive Council (FEC) has authorized the purchase and installation of electrical conductors in a bid to improve the power supply in Nigeria. Minister of Power, Abubakar Aliyu, made this known when he briefed State House media on the outcome of the Council meeting, presided over by President Muhammadu Buhari in Abuja. He said that after being installed, the conductors will assist in resolving the issue of circuit breakers frequently tripping as a result of overloaded electrical lines. He said, “The total amount for these four components of conductors is $53,131, 128.93 plus an onshore component of N2, 127, 068, 626. 45 Also  Read: Construction of Kano-Kazaure-Kongolam dual carriage road in Nigeria commissioned In order to improve the efficiency of the existing power lines, Aliyu said that new conductors would be employed. He said, “These lines are already there and are being upgraded. New wires will be installed in their place. And the difference between the two is that the new ones are more efficient because they can support heavier loads.” “They will lessen sagging because as wires age, they sag and become more fragile and heavy. The issues of continual breaker trips caused by the overloading of these lines will be much reduced. Because these ones are lighter and can transport more electricity, which will enhance efficiency,” he continued. The four parts of the contract to install electricity conductors were specified by Aliyu as  173km of the Kubotso-Hadeja line. As well as 10km of the Kumbotso-Kankiya line, 90km of the Benin-Irrua line, and 72km of the Irrua-Okpella line. Additional components were the 394-kilometer Gombe-Biu-Damboa-Maiduguri line, the 48-kilometer Okpella-Okenne line, and the 58-kilometer Okenna-Ajaokuta line. The minister added that the council had approved an N1.46 billion agreement for the procurement of 20 transformer ratio analyzers for the Nigerian Transmission Corporation. (NAN)
