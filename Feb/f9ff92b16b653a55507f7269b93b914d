Egypt’s High-Speed Rail Line Project has officially awarded its construction contract to French construction Company, NGE. Among the companies that are working with NGE include Arab Contractors and Orascom. Collaboratively, the companies will work to develop and build the 330 kilometers line. The contract was signed by NGE and its rail expertise subsidiary, TSO. Quite impressively, the project will connect the Red Sea port of Sohna with Borg al-arab near the Mediterranean port of Alexandria. Interestingly, this current project is part of a much bigger project. Back in May 2022 Egypt’s National Authority for Tunnels signed a contract to build a 2,000-kilometer railway line. As a whole, the project scheme strives to serve as the world’s sixth-largest high-speed railway line network.

An NGE statement said that it will further extend to Marsa Matrouh right on Egypt’s northwest coast. Later on, the project scheme revealed plans to build another line from Cairo to Luxor. Furthermore, the project scheme will add a rail line between Luxor and Hurghada on the Red Sea Coast. Upon inquiry, NGE declined to disclose the value of the contract. However, for the 2,000 kilometers railway line, its total cost is reportedly EGP 360 ($23 billion), approximately. Rewinding to 12 March 2018, Egypt’s Transport Minister said that the country is in the process of launching a new high-speed railway project scheme. Higham Arafat further added that the project scheme would include the participation of well over 10 international companies. Thereafter, the scheme began a series of projects including the Green Line, Blue Line, Red Line, and currently the railway line that will connect the Red Sea Port of Sokhna.
