Nearly two-thirds of the 9.1-mile, $1.6 billion Foothill Gold Line Extension light-rail project has been completed. Located in the eastern San Gabriel Valley, this line includes the majority of the grade crossing and bridge work. The Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority will regain control of the rail route for testing train cars and eventually passenger service after construction on the project is finished in the first quarter of 2025. Kiewit Corp and Parsons Corp are leading a joint venture that is building the train route.

Downtown Los Angeles’ Union Station serves as the Gold Line’s starting point. Funding for a further 3.2-mile Foothill Gold Line extension to Montclair, which would cross the border with San Bernardino County, is still lacking. In 2018, that portion of the initial project was cut off. Grade crossings and bridge construction/upgrades are two project components that are nearly finished. Crews led by Kiewit-Parsons have completed the majority of the work on 20 of the 21 at-grade crossings and 18 of the 19 new or rebuilt bridges. However, the four additional stations along the route in San Dimas, La Verne, and Pomona have just around 25% complete. One of those stations, Pomona, has yet to start construction on the main platform. The actual laying of the rail track, another significant component of the construction, is likewise 63% finished. Additionally, six of the eight electrical system power substations have been constructed, with the final two expected to be finished by the end of the year.
