This aims to achieve food security and self sufficiency. Mrs. Munyonga said that the 12 dams are expected to go a long way in providing water for agriculture. They will also provide water for domestic usage in different parts of the country. Paul Zakariya, secretary general of the Zimbabwe Farmers Union (ZFU), recently noted that small scale farmers lack the capacity to acquire water drawing equipment. This is despite the government’s continuous progress in dam construction. Once fully complete, the Marovanyati Dam will have a capacity of 50 million cubic liters. This will enable the surrounding areas to begin irrigation projects. According to Mrs. Munyonga, the project’s broader scope would facilitate irrigation based upscaling of agricultural projects. Additionally, it will also deliver water to the surrounding Murambinda growth point.

The ongoing rains and the yearly closure of the construction industry, according to Mrs. Munyonga, have caused a delay in the dam’s construction.
