Despite the fact that the contract’s value has not been made public, it may be worth several hundred million euros. The tech giant intends to invest a total of over $12.75 billion in 17 different European regions. The data centre will likely be built in San Sebastian de los Reyes, which is about 20 kilometres from Madrid.
