Preconstruction work on the terminal replacement at the Hollywood Burbank Airport has begun under the Holder, Pankow, TEC Joint Venture. Pankow Builders of Pasadena, TEC Constructors & Engineers of Inglewood, and Holder Construction of Atlanta are just a few of the members of the team. Additionally, local subcontractors have already started enquiring about the project. The joint venture was given $55 million for the initial construction and is expected to provide three concept drawings to the commission in April for review. The projected price tag has not been discussed by officials, who hope to do so this spring.

California On the north side of the east-west runway, across from the current terminal, is where the new terminal will be situated. It will take the place of a structure that was first built there in 1930. It will have 14 gates, which is the same number as the airport has now now. Modern Federal Aviation Administration rules will be included in the relocation and new building. Energy-efficient fixtures and wastewater collection, for instance, could serve as examples of these objectives. The current structure will have one year to be demolished once the new terminal opened in October 2026. The Covid-19 pandemic, which caused the project to be put on hold for about 18 months, had an effect on this schedule. The Burbank-Glendale-Pasadena Airport Authority Commission selected a joint venture organization in December. They gave them the design build contract for the airport’s new terminal. The terminal will eventually replace a structure that is almost a century old with a modern structure. The structure complies with contemporary safety regulations and has a more effective design.
