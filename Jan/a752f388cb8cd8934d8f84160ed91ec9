He led a delegation from a number of state departments on an inspection tour of the grounds. Embu Governor Cecily Mbarire and the Principal Secretaries for Defense, Roads, ICT, Broadcasting and Telecommunications, Environment, as well as Culture, were among those who were in his company. Paul Rotich, the Eastern Regional Commissioner, was also a part of the group that toured his official residence. The residence would likely serve as the venue of the Madaraka Day Luncheon. According to PS Omollo, the work is already underway and is at the paperwork stage. He claimed that he wasnâ€™t able to estimate the costs. The theme, according to Omollo, would be universal health care, which President William Ruto announced during the 2022 Jamuhuri Day commemoration. The completed projects, according to Omollo, will be a great illustration of what can be accomplished when county and national governments partner. The Sports City, according to Embu Governor Cecily Mbarire, will offer residents a number of options. He also claimed that they were really delighted to be chosen to host the event. The local leaders in attendance vowed to support the national government. They expressed optimism that the Sports City will generate up to 5,000 new employment opportunities.
