The mid-2023 opening date for SagePointe, which started building in early 2022, is anticipated. The coordinated entry system for Los Angeles County will then be used to identify residents for the new flats. In Los Angeles County, Linc is actively developing or building a number of projects. These include a projected 340 unit development that would be the largest affordable housing complex in Glendale.
