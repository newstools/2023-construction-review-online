According to Stephen Urio, manager for DAWASA project, the project’s implementation has been expedited and is already at 61 percent. The project’s objective is to improve the clean water supply in Dar es Salaam’s peripheral areas. The project, Urio said, is divided into two phases of execution, and the water source for this project is the Ruvu Up and Ruvu Down water plants, as well as the Nzasa and Kimbiji deep wells.

These pipes connected more than 2,000 customers in the process. He added that they have laid nearly 120 kilometers of pipeline in this phase, and the work is ongoing. The connection of consumers will be done in phases, particularly in areas where pipelines have already been installed. These areas are Chamazi and Buyuni wards. According to Engineer Urio, the project’s second phase included the installation of one pump with a 60 million liters per hour capacity, the construction of a water tank with a two million liter storage capacity in the Somelo-Chanika area, as well as the laying of pipes over a distance of 69.2 km and the installation of pipes. Out of a total of 69.2 kilometers, he noted that 52 kilometers of pipes have been laid so far for the second phase. According to him, the project is being carried out in the three districts of Temeke, Ilala, and Kigamboni. It is also being implemented in nine wards and 19 streets. Hashim Yasini, the chairman of Nzasa Street, requested that DAWASA closely monitor the project’s implementation. This is to ensure the locals, who obtain their water from natural wells make use of the water service.
