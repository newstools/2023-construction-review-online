Planning approval has been obtained by Countryside Partnerships and housing firm Riverside for the redevelopment of the Calverley Close estate in Beckenham neighbourhood of London. New 275 homes will be built as part of the estate rebuild. The project will however be done in stages over a ten-year period. After construction, 96 of these homes will be sold. The remaining 179 will be affordable for estate’s existing residents. With the planning permission now granted, preparation work on the site will begin in the spring of 2023. Consequently, construction will be expected to start in October 2023. Deliveries under the new plan are set to begin in early 2025. As a result, the existing residents will only need to relocate once thanks to the careful planning of this phasing.

We have worked tirelessly with residents, the council, and local community to design a scheme that delivers for everyone. This is all after the residents’ ballot approval for the regeneration in 2021. The Calverley Close estate redevelopment is a fantastic opportunity to deliver a meaningful number of quality homes for local residents. Furthermore, the project will generate a vastly improved neighbourhood and integrating existing and new communities.” The location of the site is advantageous because it is less than 15 minutes from Beckenham Hill and Beckenham Junction railway stations, which are located north and south of the site, respectively. The Public Transport Accessibility Level (PTAL) score of the site ranges from 1a to 1b. The estate is owned by The Riverside Group housing association, which named Countryside Properties Ltd as the development partner in 2018.
