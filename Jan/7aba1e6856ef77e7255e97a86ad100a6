After the demise of his predecessor in April last year, Mak’Oderoh assumed his new position. He has only been in office for a short time. Additionally, he said that in an effort to safeguard and maintain the cleanliness of the highways, KeNHA has been consulting with local cane milling companies. This was in response to citizen complaints about the numerous self-inflicted accidents caused by tractors transporting cane to mills at the Kachok Flyover on the Kisumu-Nairobi highway. The millers have been asked on multiple occasions by Mak’Oderoh to advise their transporters to follow road rules and stop littering cane fragments on the road.
