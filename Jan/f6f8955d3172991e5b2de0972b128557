The 73-room hyper-luxury Sheybarah resort project has marked a milestone through the delivery of villas to its construction site. The project’s site is located within the southeast of Red Sea Global’s archipelago in the Red Sea, right on Sheybarah Island. Home to a highly diverse environment, the island features white dune beaches alongside mangroves.

Additionally, the reefs host various species of fish as well as other marine animals. The modular Sheybarah villas were constructed offsite within Sharjah by Metal production specialist, Grankraft Industries.   Thereafter, they got shipped to Saudi Arabia via transportation. Leading heavy lifting and transportation company, Mammoet, successfully transported the villas. Back in May 2022, the Dutch company won the project’s contract to transport all 73 villa pods to Saudi Arabia. So far, the company has delivered a total number of four villas to the project’s island construction site. The Dubai-based architectural firm, Killa Design designed the Sheybarah resort project. The homes feature beach and overwater beach villas with a unique shape.

As a result, the villa homes employ highly reflective and polished stainless steel cladding. The material reflects the natural surroundings that include dunes, the sky, the ocean as well as the reef below. The project is a part of a bigger, mega-development dubbed the “Red Sea project.” As a result, every first batch of the villas for the resort project was welcomed by Red Sea Global. The remarkable developer is one of the world’s most visionary firms.
