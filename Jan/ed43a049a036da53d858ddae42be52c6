Tietto Minerals, a gold explorer and developer, has commenced wet commissioning at its Abujar Gold mine Project in Côte d’Ivoire. A sizable supply of ore has already been set up to supply the processing plant, which the company has already started commissioning. The mine should be able to supply 260,000 ounces for the first twelve months of full-scale operation once commercial production is attained in the coming weeks. Abujar should consequently result in a considerable rise in gold production in Côte d’Ivoire in 2023. Abidjan is one step closer to its objective of raising production to 65 tonnes of gold by 2025.

It was nearly impossible to complete during COVID-19 due to supply chain problems. As well as rising prices, and a shortage of skilled labor. Our internal construction team has demonstrated it can be delivered, with careful planning, meticulous management, and dedication.” “I would like to thank our mine construction team, the mining team, and key contractors like Friedlander and NCP. As well as local governments at all levels, and many other people. We also want to express our gratitude to our investors who have helped us reach the point where we can generate about 260,000 ounces in the first year of production once we achieve commercial production,” Wang added. The Abujar Gold mine Project is located approximately 30km from Daloa, a major regional city, in central western Côte D’Ivoire. It is anticipated that the open-pit gold mine would grow to be one of Côte d’Ivoire’s biggest gold mines.
