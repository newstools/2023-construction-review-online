Subway tiles have become increasingly popular in the world of home design and decorating thanks to their stylish contemporary look.

Offering infinite design options, subway tiles can add an instant modern twist to any space – from kitchens to bathrooms and beyond. Subway tiles come in a variety of sizes, shapes, and colours so that users can customise the look to reflect their own personal tastes. Whether arranged in a classic brick pattern or arranged for special artistic patterns, subway tile is an eye-catching addition to any modern living space. You can create a timeless look with subway tile options by using a monochrome palette. An elegant black-and-white combination will create a classic, chic look that is sure to be timeless. You can also add visual interest by combining multiple colours of subway tiles in the same room – for instance, using white and grey for a subtle two-tone effect. Alternatively, you can bring some vibrancy and personality to a room with bright colours.
