And boost the proportion of renewable energy sources in its energy mix to 45% by 2030. Additionally, Côte d’Ivoire has created a master plan that incorporates solar, hydroelectricity. As well as biomass for the growth of its industrial facilities. This is in compliance with its promises. Together with other measures that the Ivorian government is launching, the framework agreement we recently signed with Masdar and a first project of 50 to 70MW will help us achieve this lofty goal.” Mohamed Jameel Al Ramahi, CEO, Masdar, added, “We aim to produce 100 GW of renewable energy globally by 2030. This is part of Masdar’s new shareholding structure, which was unveiled in December. Furthermore, we see huge opportunity for the renewable energy sector across the continent given Africa’s massive expected expansion and growth and low levels of clean energy penetration at the moment. This agreement to develop solar plant in Côte d’Ivoire will help Côte d’Ivoire achieve its clean energy goals. As well as promote the country’s sustainable economic growth.”
