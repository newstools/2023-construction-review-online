London Luton Airport has submitted plans for a significant airport expansion to increase capacity from 18 million to 32 million passengers annually. The plans include community funding ideas. Over time, this could give communities in Luton and the surrounding areas an additional £14 million annually. Plans were revealed by Luton Rising, the Luton Council company that owns the airport. Consent is being sought to build a new terminal, a major programme of earthworks. By doing this, it will be possible to expand the current airfield platform and build new facilities on the airside and the landside. The Luton DART will be extended, and the surface access network will be improved, according to the airport owners. Further infrastructure improvements and initiatives are also wanted. This will help achieve the goal of zero-emission ground operations by 2040.

The project will also provide numerous community benefits and make the airport a leader in sustainable aviation. “We are currently anticipating the Inspectorate’s decision on moving on to the DCO process’ examination stage. We hope that this will usher in the next stage of our commitment to expanding London Luton Airport. Thus, Luton and the surrounding communities will have much-deserved employment, prosperity, and positive social impact.”
